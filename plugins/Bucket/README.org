#+title: Mostly compatible implementation of XKCD Bucket

* Goals

- Provide a supybot plugin that acts similar to XKCD Bucket as documented [[http://sobrieti.bot.nu/pail/][here]].
- Use SQLite3 instead of MySQL
- Provide a converter from Bucket's MySQL schema to our SQLite3 schema

Why? Because I am sick of dealing with Perl and MySQL for ~pail~ on snoonet.
