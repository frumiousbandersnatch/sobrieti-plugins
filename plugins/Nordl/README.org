An n-char implementation of wordle

* TODO

- [ ] db to hold scores, past games
- [ ] only allow real words
- [ ] multiplayer
- [ ] remove channelDB, take from msg.channel
- [ ]  add wordle style @board 


- [ ] Reject guesses of the wrong length

- [ ]  reject guesses not also a word.

- [ ] something may be wrong in how coloring works.  Prior to fixing above, guessing with all 26 letters did not light up some known to be in the word.
