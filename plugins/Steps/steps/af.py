    'Numero Uno: Us bros woke up one morning and we were like, "Dude, WTF? This shit is kickin\' my ASS, yo! I just cannot fuckin\' deal!"',
    'Point B: We were like, "I bet there\'s like some Big Bro in the Sky who can do me a solid and help me feel like I\'m not tripping major ballsack all the time."',
    'The third thing: We were like, "Not totally sure what Big Bro looks like for you, but whatevs, that\'s cool. He\'s got all our backs anyhoo."',
    'Numero Quatro: We were like, "OMG, think of aaaaaaaall the fucked-up shit we did while we were wasted!"',
    'Fiverino: We said to the Big Bro in the Sky, "Holy shit, we are total fuck-ups. And here\'s a list of why. Ready?" Just in case he was distracted with someone else\'s probs, we said it to ourselves in the mirror, and we also told it to another bro. Every. Goddam. Thing. It took like six hours.',
    'Sixx: We thought, "Dude, I am SO ready to be done with this shit. YOLO."',
    'And Seventh of All: We were like, "Big Bro, please go into God Mode and just like reset my character to level one, cool? I\'m totally willing to start over, no bonus weapons, no cheat codes, nothing. That\'s how serious I am."',
    'Ate: We wrote out this list of all the bros and babes we fucked over, and we were like, "I would totally text them and say sorries. No, for reals, I would."',
    'Niner: Sometimes we called these dudes up, and we were like, "Yo, man, you can totally kick my ass if you want, and I won\'t even fight back, because I totally deserve it and shit." Except sometimes when we knew they were still so pissed that they might like have a stroke or gouge our eyes out with a spoon or something. That would not be cool.',
    'The Big Ten: We were like, "Just what kind of bros are we, anyways? Serious question." And if we fucked up again, we were like, "Uh oh, better nip that shit in the bud."',
    'Leven: We said to the Big Bro in the Sky, "Dude, just gimme the 411, cuz obviously I don\'t know shit!" We felt kinda weird talking to someone who wasn\'t there, but it felt cool anyhow.',
    'And Twelfth Of All: We were like, "Holy shit, I totally get it now!" And if one of our bros came up to us and was like, "Dude, this shit is kickin\' my ass, and I totally cannot deal," we were like, "Hey, bro, I used to be like you. Let me tell you about Step Numero Uno."',
