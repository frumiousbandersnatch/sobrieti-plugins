    "(We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.): Very obvious reason why this is step 1.",
    "I can't ask for help unless I admit that I have a problem.",
    "I can't accept help until I realize that I'm unable to quit without help and am able to trust in the process of the steps.",
    "I practice the 3rd step here in that writing down everything here is completely counter-intuitive to how I used to be. I'm getting all of the stuff of the past out in writing.",
    "I then take all of said stuff and share it with another person. This allows me to get another perspective and to be sure that I'm being honest with myself as to what my role was.",
    "I take what I shared and I see where my character defects effected my relationships and become willing to work on them.",
    "I actively work on letting go of my character defects.",
    "Without letting go of my character defects (such as pride, having to feel morally superior, etc.) I am unable to become willing to make amends to people that I have harmed in the past.",
    "I need to be willing to clean up the wreckage of my past. Without becoming willing and having a complete list of the people I had harmed, I can't complete this step. Without completing this step, I will always have some fear of the past catching up with me.",
    "After step 9, my side of the street has been cleared. I can now move forward without fear of the past. This is a maintenance step in that I am now making sure that I am no longer creating resentments in my life or resentments towards me (that I can help. There are always going to be some people who don't agree with me) and can continue living in a way that does not cause regrets or resentments.",
    'This is continuing our maintenance. With a clear mind and conscience, I am now able to focus on continuing to achieve inner peace as best I can and doing the "next right thing".',
    "I help myself by helping others. Step 12 usually involves sponsorship where I will help another person through these steps in the hopes that they reach a spiritual awakening.",
